      I get excited about building systems that are reliable, performant, and maintainable. I've had the pleasure of doing so as a Software Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer at Google, Computer Systems Engineer at the <a href="https://www.nersc.gov" target="_blank">National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center</a>, and Computational Seismologist / Ph.D. Candidate at the <a href="https://seismo.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Berkeley Seismological Laboratory</a>.

      I enjoy spending time outdoors, cooking, and tinkering. Many of these endeavors are shared with my partner <a href="https://nbilenko.com" target="_blank">Natalia</a>.
